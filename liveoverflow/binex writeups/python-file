    import sys: This line imports the built-in Python module sys, which provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter 
    and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.

    print sys.argv: This line prints out the list of command-line arguments passed to the Python script.

    if len(sys.argv)==2:: This line checks if the length of sys.argv is exactly 2. This is checking if exactly one argument was provided to
    the script (the first element of sys.argv is always the name of the script itself).

    print("hello, {0}".format(sys.argv[1])): If exactly one argument was provided, this line prints a greeting message to the user, using the format
    method to insert the first command-line argument into the message. 
    The {0} in the message is a placeholder for the first argument, which is accessed using sys.argv[1]. The output will be "hello, "
    followed by the first command-line argument.

    else:: If the length of sys.argv is not exactly 2 (i.e., more or fewer arguments were provided), this line begins the else block.

    sys.stderr.write("Usage: {0} <name>\n".format(sys.argv[0])): This line prints an error message to the standard error stream (stderr),
    using the write method of the sys.stderr object. The message indicates the correct usage of the script (i.e., one argument, which should be a name), 
    using the format method to insert the name of the script (sys.argv[0]) into the message. The output will be something like "Usage: scriptname.py <name>".

Note: In Python 3, the print function is used instead of the print statement. So, the print statement in line 2 should be print(sys.argv).
Also, the write method in line 6 should be print(..., file=sys.stderr) in Python 3.
