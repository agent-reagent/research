 
<h1>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack </h1>
is a common vulnerability which is being exploited in web 
applicationsthrough the injection of HTML tags and malicious Java Script code.

The usual method of sanitizing Javascript code stil leavs vulnerabilites on the table,instead 
the researchers propose the use  of a Sandbox environment used in sites like blogger.com operated 
by Google.

Often the target of these attacks is to get cookies,
Cookies are the most general way to identify and authenticate
the users and it is being supported by almost all the web
browsers.

Recent survey has shown that almost 67% of websites are vulnerable to XSS attacks.

<h2><i>Detection of XSS Vulnerability:</i></h2>
we could do a static source code analysis or do dynamic testing by executing known attacks on 
the site.
L-WMxD (Lexical based Webmail XSS
Discoverer), which works on a lexical based mutation engine
which is an active defence system to discover XSS before the
Webmail application is online for service.
Pixy is a tool that performs data flow
analysis on PHP code to detect reflected XSS vulnerabilities.
Various prototype tools which are based on Pixy have been
implemented by the researchers and test on the real world
PHP programs.

<h2><i>Prevention of XSS Vulnerability</i></h2>
application-level firewall is suggested,
which is located on a security gateway between client and
server and which applies all the security relevant checks and
transformations. Some server side prevention approaches
require the collaboration of web browsers.

On the client side, researchers have developed the Noxes
 which acts as a personal firewal on the basis of filter rules,a user-specified URL white-list and blacklist
websites. During the HTTP request to an unknown website, Noxes immediately alerts the client, who
chooses to permit or deny the connection, and remembers the
clientâ€™s action for future use. Another client side approach which aims to identify the information
leakage using tainting of input data in the browser or 
mechanism for detecting malicious java script is proposed: the system consists of a browser-embedded script auditing
component, and IDS that processes the audit logs and compares them to signatures of known malicious behavior or attacks.

There are no logical server side solutions, as they face a deployment issue and degrade the web speed also.
<h2><i>ARCHITECTURE OF EXPLOITING
XSS VULNERABILITY</i></h2>

Web applications frequently use cookies for retaining an authentication state between users and web applications.
These cookies are usually sent to the users by the web applications after the users have been successfully
authenticated. Every consequent request that contains the legitimate cookies will be automatically approved by the web
applications without any further authentication.
Hence they are the target for vulnerabilities.
